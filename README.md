# 🛠️ Writeups Repository

Welcome to my collection of **writeups** from different cybersecurity platforms and labs.  
This repository serves as a personal knowledge base where I document my learning process, methodologies, and solutions.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the platform or source of the challenge:

- **DockerLabs/** → Writeups from [Dockerlabs](https://dockerlabs.es/).
- **HTB/** → Writeups from [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/).
- _(More folders will be added as I progress.)_

Each writeup includes:

- Challenge/machine description
- Step-by-step methodology
- Commands, tools, and scripts used
- Screenshots or outputs (when needed)
- Final thoughts / lessons learned

## 🚀 Purpose

- To document my penetration testing journey.
- To share methodologies that may help others in their learning path.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

All content is for **educational purposes only**.  
Do not attempt any techniques against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

## 📌 Notes

- Writeups will be continuously updated as I progress.
- Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
