# CTF Writeups

This repository contains my writeups of **Dockerlabs**, **HackerLabs**, and **HackTheBox** — platforms focused on **cybersecurity and pentesting**. The goal is to document my learning process, share techniques used, and show the resolution of different challenges and machines.

---

## About The Labs

These labs (Dockerlabs, HackerLabs, HackTheBox) let you deploy and practice cybersecurity scenarios using VMs or containers. They provide **vulnerable machines**, **exploitation challenges**, and scenarios designed to practice from beginner to advanced levels. They are excellent options to prepare for security certifications and improve skills in **ethical hacking**.

## Repository Goal

- Document the resolution of challenges and machines.
- Explain step-by-step the exploited vulnerabilities.
- Serve as a personal reference and for other security students.
- Improve technical writing of writeups.
